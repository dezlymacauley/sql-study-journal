## Relational Databases
A structured database containing tables that are related to each other.
Tables contain collumns and rows (also called records)

Relational databases often have multiple tables.
Two tables can be connected if they share a common column.

The collumns that relate two tables to each other are called keys.

## Primary Key
A collumn where every row has a unique entry.
The primary key must not have any null or duplicate values,
or any null or empty values.

## Foreign key
A collumn in a table that is a primary key in another table

## NOTE: A table can have multiple Foreign Keys, but only one Primary Key
